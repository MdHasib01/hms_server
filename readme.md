   cd medicore-hms
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash

   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials and other configuration
   ```

4. Set up the database

   ```bash
   # Create the database
   createdb medicore_hms

   # Run migrations (if applicable)
   go run cmd/migrate/main.go
   ```

5. Run the application

1. Register or login to get your token
2. Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
   ```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### API Documentation

Swagger documentation is available at `/swagger/index.html` when the server is running.

You can also find the full API specification in the `swagger.json` file.

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t medicore-hms .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env medicore-hms
```

### Production Considerations

- Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Configure proper database connection pooling
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement database backups
